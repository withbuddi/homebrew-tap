  caveats <<~EOS
    buddi installs its own command-line tool: open buddi and choose
    Install Command-Line Tool from its menu.

    buddi keeps your data in ~/Library/Application Support/buddi; remove it
    from the app's menu, or `brew zap buddi` after `brew uninstall buddi`.
    `brew uninstall buddi` leaves your data in place; the app's own
    Remove buddi... is the full uninstall.
